# constraint

// The original query has constant 10000 instead of 10

{
  "constants": ["10"],
  "aggregation_functions": []
}

# output

author:Str,NumPosts:Int
99,11

# solution

```sql
SELECT author, COUNT(1) AS NumPosts
FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.comments`
GROUP BY author
HAVING COUNT(1) > 10000
```
