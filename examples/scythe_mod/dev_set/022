#solution

```sql
with All_Sales (Id, Fruit) 
as (
select Id, Fruit1 as Fruit from Sales where not Fruit1 is null
union all
select Id, Fruit2 as Fruit from Sales where not Fruit2 is null
union all 
select Id, Fruit3 as Fruit from Sales where not Fruit3 is null
union all 
select Id, Fruit4 as Fruit from Sales where not Fruit4 is null
)

select as1.Id as Id1, as2.Id as Id2, as1.Fruit 
from All_Sales as as1 inner join All_Sales as as2 on as1.Fruit = as2.fruit And as1.Id < as2.Id
```
