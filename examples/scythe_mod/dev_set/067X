#solution

```sql
select t2.date, count(t1.cnt), count(t2.cnt)
from (select date, count(*) cnt from input2 group by date) t2
left join (select date, count(*) cnt from input1 group by date) t1
  on t2.date = t1.date
group by t2.date
```

```sql
select date, count(t1.cnt), count(t2.cnt)
from (select date, count(*) cnt from input1 group by date) t1
full outer join (select date, count(*) cnt from input2 group by date) t2
  using (date)
group by date
```

```sql
SELECT Date,
       Item1,
       Item2 
  FROM
     (  
        SELECT T1.Date AS Date,
               COUNT(  T1.Item  ) AS Item1,                     
               COUNT(  T2.Item  ) AS Item2  
          FROM Table1 t1
        LEFT JOIN
               Table2 t2  
            ON t1.date = t2.date  
        GROUP BY t1.Date              
  UNION              
        SELECT T2.Date AS Date,
               COUNT( T1.Item ) AS Item1,
               COUNT( T2.Item ) AS Item2
          FROM Table2 t2
        LEFT JOIN
