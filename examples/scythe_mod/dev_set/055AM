```sql
SELECT
    Product_ID 
FROM
    input1 
GROUP BY
    Product_ID 
HAVING
    max(Client_ID) = 233 
    AND min(Client_ID) = 233 
ORDER BY
    Product_ID ASC
```

```sql
SELECT st.Product_ID
FROM SomeTable st,
(
    SELECT Product_ID
    FROM SomeTable
    GROUP BY Product_ID
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) tmp (Product_ID)
WHERE tmp.Product_ID = st.Product_ID
and st.Client_ID = 2
