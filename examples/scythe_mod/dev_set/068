	"aggregation_functions": ["sum"]
}

#solution

```sql
SELECT
    created_at,
    sum(count) OVER (ORDER BY created_at ASC) 
FROM
    input1 
ORDER BY
    created_at ASC
```

```sql
SELECT
  s1.created_at,
  SUM(count) AS cumul_count
FROM subscriptions s1
  INNER JOIN subscriptions s2 ON s1.created_at >= s2.created_at
GROUP BY s1.created_at
```
