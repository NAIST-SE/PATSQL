```sql
SELECT basetable.letter as test_letter, basetable.d1, basetable.d2,
       overlaptable.letter as overlap_letter, overlaptable.d1 as overlap_d1, overlaptable.d2 as overlap_d2
FROM test basetable JOIN
     test overlaptable
     ON basetable.d1 <= overlaptable.d2 AND
        basetable.d2 >= overlaptable.d1
WHERE basetable.letter < overlaptable.letter  -- This is the change
ORDER BY basetable.letter, basetable.d1;
```
