# solution

```sql
-- MySQL
SELECT BALL.Month, avg(BALL.Color='Blue') 
FROM BALL    
GROUP BY BALL.Month;
```

```sql
-- PostgreSQL
select month, coalesce(cast(i as double precision) / j, 0)
from (select month, count(*) as i from ball where color = 'blue' group by month) x
  right join (select month, count(*) as j from ball group by month) y
    using (month);
```

```sql
-- PostgreSQL syntax (not working)
SELECT BALL.Month, avg(CAST (CASE WHEN BALL.Color='Blue' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS real)) 
FROM BALL
GROUP BY BALL.Month;
```
